    "Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain. The World Health Organization[[5]](#ref_5) estimates that it affects around 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized). The estimated proportion of the general population with active epilepsy (i.e. continuing seizures or with the need for treatment) is between 4 and 10 per 1000 people.\n",

    "* Seizure episodes are a result of **excessive electrical discharges** in a group of brain cells. \n",

    "\n",
    "Although many underlying disease mechanisms can lead to epilepsy, the cause of the disease is still unknown in about 50% of cases globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epilepsy is not always properly diagnosed**, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where almost 80% of people with epilepsy live. An abnormal **electroencephalography (EEG) pattern is one of the two most consistent predictors of seizure recurrence** (as one seizure does not signify epilepsy).\n",

The risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than in the general population. **Persistent epileptic seizure are considered as such as an emergency** and can cause particularly serious sequelae. In addition, **a great proportion of the causes of death related to epilepsy are potentially preventable**, such as falls, drowning, burns and prolonged seizures. \n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\rightarrow$ *Medical intervention at the onset of an epileptic seizure reduces the risk of complications.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, seizures can be controlled: most of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free with appropriate use of antiseizure medicines. Discontinuing antiseizure medicine can even be considered after 2 years without seizures. Surgery might also be beneficial to patients who respond poorly to drug treatments."

However, these methods provide unsatisfactory results. Better results can be obtained by using time-frequency analysis, but these methods are costly in terms of computation and memory. One could use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to extract features from EEG, but as it is often used with SVM (Support Vector Machine), it is highly computationally expensive. Deep learning with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) are promising alternatives."
