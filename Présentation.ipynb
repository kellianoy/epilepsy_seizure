    "Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain. The WHO<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a><sup>[5]</sup> estimates that it affects around 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized). The estimated proportion of the general population with active epilepsy (i.e. continuing seizures or with the need for treatment) is between 4 and 10 per 1000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seizure episodes are a result of **excessive electrical discharges** in a group of brain cells. \n",
    "* **Different parts of the brain** can be the site of such discharges. \n",
    "* Seizures can **vary in duration** from the briefest lapses of muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. \n",
    "* Seizures can also **vary in frequency**, from less than one per year to several per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of seizures vary and depend on where in the brain the disturbance first starts, and how far it spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causes & Treatment\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many underlying disease mechanisms can lead to epilepsy, the cause of the disease is still unknown in about 50% of cases globally. An estimated 25% of epilepsy cases are potentially preventable. Preventing head injury, for example by reducing falls, traffic accidents and sports injuries, is the most effective way to prevent post-traumatic epilepsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "People with epilepsy tend to have more physical problems (such as fractures), as well as higher risks of psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression. The risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than in the general population. A **great proportion of the causes of death related to epilepsy are potentially preventable**, such as falls, drowning, burns and prolonged seizures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seizures can be controlled. Most of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free with appropriate use of antiseizure medicines. Discontinuing antiseizure medicine can even be considered after 2 years without seizures. Surgery might be beneficial to patients who respond poorly to drug treatments.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "About two-thirds of people suffering from epilepsy can be treated with medication, and 7-8% can be cured with surgery. Unfortunately, the remaining patients suffer from refractory epilepsy, meaning that they are not able to control their seizures. Therefore, the **detection of seizures is critical for these patients, as it can help them to counter side effects from a seizure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG (electroencephalogram) are signals used to detect seizures. These signals can be divided into two types: interictal, which are signals recorded between seizures, and ictal, which are signals recorded during seizures and can be used to detect abnormal seizures and notify the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the article cited at the beginning of the notebook, most of the methods relying on these data are based on ideas such as thresholding or basic machine learning models. However, these methods do not provide satisfactory results. Better results can be obtained by using time-frequency analysis, but these methods are costly in terms of computation and memory. One could use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to extract features from EEG, but as it is often used with SVM (Support Vector Machine), it is highly computationally expensive. Deep learning with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) are promising alternatives."
